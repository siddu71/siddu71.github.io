# Test Page

Welcome to the test page! This is a simple Markdown file added to the root directory to test the dynamic generation of sidebar navigation links in a Jekyll site.

You can add any content here: text, images, links, etc. The purpose of this page is to show how easily new pages can be added to your site and automatically be included in the sidebar navigation, assuming your theme and site configuration support this behavior.
